## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Smart Account/Card Selection

```javascript
// Payment method determines which dropdown appears
if (payment_method === 'credit_card') {
  // Show card dropdown
  <select>
    <option>Visa Gold</option>
    <option>Mastercard Black</option>
  </select>
} else if (payment_method === 'bank_account') {
  // Show account dropdown
  <select>
    <option>Conta Corrente</option>
    <option>Poupança</option>
  </select>
}
```

### 2. Backwards Compatible

```javascript
// Cards prop is optional with default
const ImportModal = ({ 
  show, 
  onClose, 
  user, 
  accounts, 
  categories, 
  cards = []  // Default to empty array
}) => {
  // Works with or without cards
}
```

### 3. Context-Aware UI

The UI adapts based on:
- Transaction type (expense/income/investment)
- Payment method selected
- Available accounts/cards
