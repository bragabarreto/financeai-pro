# Payment Method Update - Summary

## Overview

This update improves payment method selection and account/card association in the import system, providing better specificity and user control.

## Key Changes

### 1. Removed "Conta Bancária" Payment Method

**Rationale**: The generic "Conta Bancária" (Bank Account) option has been replaced with more specific payment methods for better transaction categorization.

#### For Expenses:
- ❌ **Removed**: Conta Bancária
- ✅ **Use instead**: 
  - PIX (for PIX transfers)
  - Transferência (for bank transfers/TED/DOC)
  - Cartão de Débito (for debit card transactions)

#### For Income:
- ❌ **Removed**: Crédito em Conta
- ✅ **Use instead**:
  - Transferência (for bank transfers)
  - PIX (for PIX receipts)

### 2. Updated Account/Card Selection Logic

The system now intelligently shows account or card dropdowns based on payment method:

| Payment Method | Shows Dropdown | Example Options |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Cartão de Crédito | **Card** dropdown | Visa Gold, Mastercard Black |
| Cartão de Débito | **Account** dropdown | Conta Corrente, Poupança |
| PIX | **Account** dropdown | Conta Corrente, Poupança |
| Transferência | **Account** dropdown | Conta Corrente, Poupança |
| Aplicação (Investment) | **Account** dropdown | Conta Corrente, Poupança |
| Resgate (Investment) | **Account** dropdown | Conta Corrente, Poupança |
| Contracheque | N/A | - |

### 3. AI Extractor Updates

The AI-powered transaction extractor now maps detected "bank_account" values to "transfer" for better specificity. This ensures imported data uses the new, more precise payment method categories.

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Data

Existing transactions with `payment_method = 'bank_account'` will continue to work. The system maintains backward compatibility:

- UI still recognizes `bank_account` value
- Account dropdown will be shown for these transactions
- Users can manually update to more specific methods (PIX/Transfer/Debit Card)

### For New Imports

When importing new transactions:

1. **For expense transactions via bank account**:
   - Select "PIX" if payment was made via PIX
   - Select "Transferência" if payment was TED/DOC
   - Select "Cartão de Débito" if using debit card

2. **For income transactions to bank account**:
   - Select "Transferência" for deposits
   - Select "PIX" for PIX receipts

## Benefits

1. **Better Categorization**: More precise transaction categorization with specific payment methods
2. **Clearer Intent**: Users explicitly choose how payment was made
3. **Improved Reports**: Better analytics with granular payment method data
4. **Account Association**: All account-based payments (debit, PIX, transfer) now properly link to specific accounts
